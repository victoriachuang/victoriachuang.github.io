			I graduated from NYU in December 2013 with a bachelor's degree in nutrition. Soon after I graduated, I started working as a nutritionist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health--and I very quickly realized I wasn't feeling challenged with my work, and that I wanted to do more. During this time, I started skipping lunch breaks to learn Python and C, which was how I realized that I'm really passionate about programming. I am a recent graduate from Dev Bootcamp--see my projects <a href="projects.html">here</a> and feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>!
