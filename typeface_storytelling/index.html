      <p>The ability to express personality is very important to me, and as I've started to lose my hearing over time, I've become increasingly visual. I find typeface incredibly expressive; even if your words are never spoken, typeface expresses voice and character.</p>
      <p>The goal of this mini project is to retell stories with just the punchline, and to build context and voices through different fonts. Because the point of these images is to illustrate personality, the fonts used will be kitschier and more novel than fonts I would use in, say, a resume.</p>
