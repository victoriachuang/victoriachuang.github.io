      <div class="small-4 columns projectTitle">Artificial Life Project</div>
      <div class="small-8 columns content">Our artificial life group built a 2.5D biomechanical simulation of a salamander.  The simulation shows
        our salamander as an articulated body that interacts with its environment to achieve various locomotive states.
        The aim of the simulation was to implement a robust biomechanical model whose motion is comparable to the
        aquatic and terrestrial locomotion to that of a real salamander. Our model uses a motor-based approach to
        control the contraction and expansion of abstract muscles at the joints, as opposed to the traditional spring
        based models, which allows for a higher level of control. Here is a link to the project page: <a href="275Project.html" target='_blank'>here</a>

    <div class="row" id='visualModeling'>
      <div class="small-8 columns content">Our visual modeling group researched how to effectively create a 3D reconstruction from a 2D image.
        Our results utilized a particle mesh formed by a mass-spring-damper
        system to reconstruct objects from a 2D image. Our method is based on a pre-existing model that implements a rigid
        spine with a deformable mesh that prefers axial symmetry. The model allows for user interaction during the 3D reconstruction simulation, by implementing seed points that pull the mesh using spring forces and applying on-the-fly springs. The aim of the simulation was to implement features that assist in avoiding local minima, as well as to implement a working 3D reconstruction model.

      <div class="small-8 columns content">Our animation group researched how to effectively simulate cloth using a particle mesh formed by a mass-spring-damper
        system. Our method uses a thoroughly connected spring system and we chose to simulate physical forces on the environment as well.
        the physical forces that were implemented include: gravity, wind, and friction. Here is a link to the project page: <a href="274AProject.html">here</a>

    <div class="row" id='introGraphics'>

      <div class="small-8 columns content">I created a mini animation of a popular game: League of Legends using OpenGL and C++. The animation
        dispplays the 2 characters interacting while changing the modelview matrix and camera matrix through the world. I coded different shaders, added textures to shapes, and created my own shape (stars) using vertices and surface normals.

    <div class="row" id='computationalGenetics'>
      <div class="small-4 columns projectTitle">Computational Genetics Project Update</div>
      <div class="small-8 columns content">I focused on implementing a genome generator which included the following mutations: Single nuclotide polymorphism, Insertions and Deletions, Copy numbers, Inversions, Short tandem repeats, and ALUs. Developed an F1-based scoring method for each category. My scripts were implemented through a website for grading the accuracy and efficiency of the undergraduate computational genetics class. The full website is located<a href="https://cm124.herokuapp.com/" target='_blank'> here</a>.

    <div class="row" id='electromagnetism'>

      <div class="small-8 columns content">Designed and constructed a model for a physics simulation-based java application. I coded the base model and physics engine for the video game in order to facilitate the implementation of multiple game stages. The game uses a projectile motion to begin the trajectory of the particle. There are multiple forces that can be implemented: Gravitational, Electric, and magnetic forces. The game allows for the user to use a charge to move the particle around by simulation Coulomb's Law. The obstacles have a health level that can be depleted by knocking into the object at high velocities. Runs in windows and needs updated Java, download the jar file <a href="BallGameAW.jar" target="_blank">here!</a>

      <div class="small-4 columns projectTitle">Spatial Dependence of Boundary Layers in Simulations of Rayleigh Benard Convection</div>
      <div class="small-8 columns content">Produced and modified existing Matlab programs to perform a thorough data analysis on boundary layers in Rayleigh-Bernard cells. Previous version had 30% width bands at 3 specified locations. My analysis was of 1% bands specified at 12 locations, allowing for a more detailed examination of the behaviors found in Rayleigh Bernard cells.
