    <h4 class='header' id='artificialLife'>Artificial Life Project</h4>

    <p class='content'>
      Our artificial life group built a 2.5D biomechanical simulation of a salamander.  The simulation shows
      our salamander as an articulated body that interacts with its environment to achieve various locomotive states.
      The aim of the simulation was to implement a robust biomechanical model whose motion is comparable to the
      aquatic and terrestrial locomotion to that of a real salamander. Our model uses a motor-based approach to
      control the contraction and expansion of abstract muscles at the joints, as opposed to the traditional spring
      based models, which allows for a higher level of control. Here is a link to the project page: <a href="275Project.html" target='_blank'>here</a>

    <h4 class='header' id='visualModeling'>Visual Modeling Project</h4>

    <p class='content'>
      Our visual modeling group researched how to effectively create a 3D reconstruction from a 2D image.
      Our results utilized a particle mesh formed by a mass-spring-damper
      system to reconstruct objects from a 2D image. Our method is based on a pre-existing model that implements a rigid
      spine with a deformable mesh that prefers axial symmetry. The model allows for user interaction during the 3D reconstruction simulation, by implementing seed points that pull the mesh using spring forces and applying on-the-fly springs. The aim of the simulation was to implement features that assist in avoiding local minima, as well as to implement a working 3D reconstruction model.

    <h4 class='header' id='animation'>Animation Project</h4>

    <p class='content'>
      Our animation group researched how to effectively simulate cloth using a particle mesh formed by a mass-spring-damper
      system. Our method uses a thoroughly connected spring system and we chose to simulate physical forces on the environment as well.
      the physical forces that were implemented include: gravity, wind, and friction. Here is a link to the project page: <a href="274AProject.html">here</a>

    <h4 class='header' id='introGraphics'>Intro Graphics Project</h4>

    <p class='content'>
      I created a mini animation of a popular game: League of Legends using OpenGL and C++. The animation
      dispplays the 2 characters interacting while changing the modelview matrix and camera matrix
      through the world. I coded different shaders, added textures to shapes, and created my own shape (stars)
      using vertices and surface normals.

    <h4 class='header' id='computationalGenetics'>Computational Genetics Project Update</h4>

    <p class='content'>
      I focused on implementing a genome generator which included the following mutations:
      Single nuclotide polymorphism, Insertions and Deletions, Copy numbers, Inversions,
      Short tandem repeats, and ALUs. Developed an F1-based scoring method for each category.
      My scripts were implemented through a website for grading the accuracy and efficiency
      of the undergraduate computational genetics class. The full website is located

    <h4 class='header' id='electromagnetism'>Electromagnetism physical simulation</h4>

    <p class='content'>
      Designed and constructed a model for a physics simulation-based java application.
      I coded the base model and physics engine for the video game in order to facilitate the
      implementation of multiple game stages. The game uses a projectile motion to begin the trajectory of the particle.
      There are multiple forces that can be implemented: Gravitational, Electric, and magnetic forces. The
      game allows for the user to use a charge to move the particle around by simulation Coulomb's Law.
      The obstacles have a health level that can be depleted by knocking into the object at high velocities.
      Runs in windows and needs updated Java, download the jar file <a href="BallGameAW.jar" target="_blank">here!</a>

    <p class='content'>
      Produced and modified existing Matlab programs to perform a thorough data analysis on boundary layers in Rayleigh-Bernard cells.
      Previous version had 30% width bands at 3 specified locations. My analysis was of 1% bands specified at 12 locations, allowing
      for a more detailed examination of the behaviors found in Rayleigh Bernard cells. Presented at 65th Annual Meeting of the APS

      Generated a thorough library of models using the stellar atmospheric models MARCS with the radiative transfer code DUSTY.
      Created a program to perform analysis on photometry using band correcting methods and methods of least reduced chi-squared,
      using a series of Fortran, Perl and Python scripts. Extensive debugging and testing of code implementation, computational and physical.
