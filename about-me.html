			<h3>Hi, I'm Victoria!</h3>
			<p>I graduated from NYU in December 2013 with a bachelor's degree in nutrition. Soon after I graduated, I started working as a nutritionist at the San Francisco Department of Public Health--and I quickly realized that I wasn't feeling challenged with my work, and that I wanted to do <em>more</em>. During this time, I started skipping lunch breaks to learn coding, which was how I realized that I was really passionate about it. I am currently enrolled in Dev Bootcamp, where I hope to gain the skillset I need to become a web developer! Follow my learning journey on <a href="blog/index.html"><strong>my blog</strong></a> and feel free to <a href="contact-me.html"><strong>contact me</strong></a>!</p>
