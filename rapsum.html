    <p>Rapsum is a Ruby gem that generates rap lyrics. While creating dummy seeds for various tests and databases, I was uninspired by basic Ipsum Lorem, so I decided to create a version that I thought would be fun to use. My top priority for this project is to maintain clean, readable code and good documentation.</p>
    <p>This is still a work in progress, so please download it, try it out, and let me know what you think! See it <a href="https://github.com/victoriachuang/Rapsum" target="_blank">here on Github</a> and <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rapsum" target="_blank">here on rubygems.org</a>!</p>

    <p>Future plans for this project include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Searching by artists and keywords</li>
      <li>"Safe for work" output filters</li>
      <li>Extended categories of output, such as email addresses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Stylistic choices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I recognize that, in Ruby, double quotes are better reserved for strings with interpolation (it can affect runtime); however, for the sake of readability and consistency, I decided to use double quotes for all strings. This will also minimize errors, such as forgetting to escape a single quote.</li>
      <li>I decided to alphabetize required files and module methods. This makes going back to the file and trying to find specific things much easier!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What I've learned (so far):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Publishing a ruby gem wasn't scary at all. When I started learning ruby and using gems, I was really intimidated by what they can do, so much so that I didn't even try to understand what they were or did. Now I've learned that there's no harm in diving deep and understanding how something works!</li>
      <li>Be deliberate about the commits and changes that I make. I'm so used to the notion of "commit early, commit often" that I did the same thing with publishing new versions of Rapsum, which resulted in a lot of buggy published versions. I learned to adequately and thoroughly test the gem before publishing new versions--this is a product, not a draft!</li>
      <li>Clear documentation is important! Otherwise, how would people know how to use the gem?</li>
    </ul>
