      <p class="title">Learning JavaScript</p>
      <p class="date">November 20th, 2014</p>
      <p>This week at Dev Bootcamp was focused on learning JavaScript. Before starting DBC, I had already completed the JS course on Codecademy, so I felt like I already had a decent grasp of the language and syntax. For the most part, I didn't think this week was too much of a challenge; I think getting past the Ruby hurdles made this week feel like a breeze!</p>
      <p>Doing this week's challenges has made me reflect on how I learn best. I was really happy that I did the Codecademy track, because you code every step of the way, as opposed to reading ten pages and then coding one line. JavaScript is also the fourth language that I've learned, and a lot of parallels and similarities are starting to appear. As opposed to just learning a language, my approach now is to learn concepts. I feel like this is a better use of my time, as opposed to reading a book cover to cover, and re-reading about mathetmatical operators and why loops are useful.</p>
      <p>Looking at the way loops differ in Ruby and JavaScript (good segue, right?), I feel like the syntax in Ruby is a lot more flexible. There are so many ways you can loop in Ruby:</p>
      <p><code>x.times do<br>
      while<br>
      until<br>
      for<br>
      x.each do</code></p>
      <p>For the most part, Ruby's syntax is very conversational; you type what you want to do, and that's the name of the method!</p>
      <p>There are a lot of ways to loop in JS as well, but I feel like the syntax more closely mimics that of C. In JavaScript, one way to loop is (using printing 1 to 10 as an example):</p>
      <p><code>for (var i = 1; i < 11; i++) {<br>
      &nbsp;console.log(i);<br>
      }</code></p>
      <p>The first line, following the <code>for</code>, there is a statement that includes an initialization, condition, and increments/decrements. The initialization, <code>var i = 1</code>, declares a variable <code>i</code> and assigns it a value of <code>1</code>. The condition, <code>i < 11</code>, is checked every time the loop is performed; if the condition is true, then the loop will be executed. The last part of the statement, the increments/decrements, is <code>i++</code>; this ensures that <code>i</code>'s value changes so that you don't end up in an infinite loop. <code>i++</code> will add 1 to <code>i</code> each time the loop is executed--and once <code>i</code> is no longer less than 11, the loop will break.</p>
      <p>I actually learned C way before I learned Ruby, so this syntax for constructing a loop is not foreign to me; plus, I think it teaches some concepts that are essential to computer science. Speaking of which, I think the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/"><strong>Harvard CS50</strong></a> and <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/accounts/login?next=/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/courseware/z100/"><strong>Stanford CS101</strong></a> courses were immensely helpful in me picking up DBC material quickly and effectively; I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants supplementary material to watch; these instructors are really wonderful at explaining themselves. (I prefer the Stanford course, but Harvard's teaches C!).</p>
