			<p>Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp is almost over! I felt that this week's challenges have been pretty straightforward so far--a lot of readings and videos-and I learned the concepts best by doing. Coming into phase 0, I already had some knowledge of the command line (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.VDhRqdTF_FM">Harvard's CS50 course</a> was really helpful), so I spent the bulk of this week learning about Git and GitHub. I tried not to talk about Git in terms of "basically..." this week, because I know it's a lot more complicated and there's still a lot for me to learn about it, but here's some of what I took away from this week:

				<list>
    				<li>Git is a version control system, where each commit is a "save point" where you can go back and review the progression of a project. This is useful in tracking bugs as well.</li>
    				<li>Git is also very valuable in team projects, because it allows multiple people to work on the same project. There is a master copy of the project, and you can create branches to work on your own changes. When you're done with your portion of the project, you can commit your changes to your branch, and then merge those changes to the master.</li>
   				   <li>GitHub, on the other hand, serves as a remote host of your code. Although there are several online remote hosts available, GitHub is the most widely used. Pushing your code onto GitHub allows you to host your project online, so that your teammates can work on the project without having to be on the same server or network.</li>
