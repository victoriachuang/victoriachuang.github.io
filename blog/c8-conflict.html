      <p class="title">Conflict and the Compass of Shame</p>
      <p class="date"><--Date--></p>
      <p>According to the Compass of Shame, we all lean toward one coping mechanism when we face conflict or shame:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal</strong>: You must physically or emotionally extract yourself from the situation</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidance</strong>: You avoid the conflict by immersing yourself in something else</li>
        <li><strong>Attack others</strong>: You lash out physically or verbally and target others</li>
        <li><strong>Attack self</strong>: You put yourself down</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The most emotionally difficult time of my life so far has been my relationship with my ex-boyfriend (I know--really personal, but really educational). We were best friends, and then we started dating. At the time, I was still doing my undergrad in New York, and he lived in the Bay Area, and we did long distance for almost three years before I graduated and moved to Cupertino. Like every relationship, it started out perfect. But have you ever experienced a situation where you think you're in love, and then when you get out of it, you realize that's not what love is? That's what happened to me.</p>
      <p>He had never been a popular person--and when he moved to South Bay for work, he was completely alone. He had no friends or family with him, and I was across the country. About two years after we started dating, though, he met a group of guys from UPenn and very quickly became very close with them. It was the first time he had ever had both friends and a girlfriend, and then he started treating me very differently. This was when I realized that he was, for a lack of a better term, a seriously fucked up person.</p>
      <p>For the next two years, I was pretty badly emotionally abused. I was called fat (I'm a size 00), ugly, immature, and dependent. His favorite thing to say to me was, "You fell from heaven, and on your way down, you hit every branch of the ugly tree with your face." He also thought he was a very funny person.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, we went to a party and he met a girl who lived in New York. A few days after the party, he didn't break up with me, but he told me that he didn't like me anymore. And while I cried hysterically, he said that he was going to visit New York Girl on my birthday weekend, and asked me to give him a ride to and from the airport. I really wish I was making all of this up.</p>
      <p>So you might be wondering, why did I stay with this jerk for so long? Well, I had lost all my self esteem, so I was constantly blaming myself for everything that was wrong, even though I was inordinately kind and loving. At the same time he would always say that I will never find anyone who loved me more than he did, which I took to mean that I couldn't do better (although now I know that I can, and I have--wink wink, high fives all around).</p>
      <p>I have never been someone who has difficult conversations, and I hate confrontation, so I stopped admitting that I was unhappy. This terrible situation was also compounded by the fact that I am a serious self-attacker, and that if I care about someone, I won't stand up for myself.</p>
      <p>Nothing really happened for me to realize that I had to get out of that relationship--I literally woke up one morning and realized that I'm smart, kind, and hot, people love me, and he's a damn weirdo for treating me badly.</p>
      <p>When I broke up with him, I didn't even feel sad, and I didn't even need to get over him; I was just exhausted and I finally felt free. This whole experience has taught me that my feelings and seeing are valid, I deserve to be respected, and I deserve to be heard. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again--I can't say that I now have self esteem, but being surrounded by nice people doesn't hurt :)</p>
      <p>There is a happy ending to this story though: soon after we broke up, he broke down and waited outside my house all night while I was on a date. #wuttttt.</p>
