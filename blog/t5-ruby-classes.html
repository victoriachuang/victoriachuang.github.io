      <p class="title">Ruby Classes</p>
      <p class="date">November 6th, 2014</p>
      <p>Every object in Ruby belongs to a certain class (for example, strings belong to the String class). Classes determine an object's functionality and how you can manipulate data, so they're a convenient way to create several objects that you want to have similar behaviors (ie. have the same methods).</p>

<strong>Methods</strong>
<p>Built-in classes, such as arrays, strings, and integers, come with methods that can be called on instances of those classes. For example, in <code>array1 = Array.new</code>, <code>array1</code> becomes a new instance of the array class and inherits all of its properties--therefore, you could call any array method on <code>array1</code>. You can also write your own instance and class methods, and even methods that only apply to one instance (singleton methods), to differentiate between objects and modify behavior.
</p>

<strong>Initializing class objects</strong>
<p>Every class object is initialized with some certain properties. For example, if you were to make a new instance of class Car, you might initialize it with make, year, and color properties.</p>

<p>
<code>class Car<br>
&nbsp;def initialize(make, year, color)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@make = make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@year = year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@color = color<br>
&nbsp;end<br>
end</code>
</p>

<p>Notice that I'm setting the parameters to their equivalent with an @ sign; this allows me to access the variable in other methods in the class!</p>
