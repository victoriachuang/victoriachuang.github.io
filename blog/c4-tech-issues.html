			<p class="title">Issues in Tech: Underrepresentation of Women</p>
			<p class="date">October 27th, 2014</p>
			<p>This past weekend I marathoned <em>Silicon Valley</em>, which is supposed to give people a look into the tech world. One scene that really caught my attention was this clip:</p>
			<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gKftzAbfcGU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
			<p>In a nutshell, the CEO of Hooli (fake Google) observes that every group of programmers is composed of the same elements; a mix of white, Indian, and Asian guys, and "a guy with crazy facial hair." As an Asian woman aspiring to work in tech, I belong to a significant minority--<a href ="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/29/178810467/blazing-the-trail-for-female-programmers">only about 20% of programmers are women</a>.</p>

			<p>To be honest, I've never experienced sexism in school or in the workplace (I have had to leave a few jobs due to sexual harrassment, but that's a different animal). My alma mater, NYU, is a fiercely feminist environment, and the fields that I have worked in (communications and nutrition) are overwhelmingly populated by women. I have never been in an environment in which my peers or supervisors have deemed me less competent or intelligent because of my identity.</p>
			<p>However, I have experienced sexism through my heritage. I'm from Taiwan, where a girl's highest aspiration is to marry rich. I remember a relative or family friend telling my parents about me, "The way she looks--she's not going to land a rich husband, so let her be smart." When I was in the process of applying to college, my first instinct was to major in chemical engineering--and my mom stopped me by telling me that female engineers are ugly and will never get married. My 16-year-old self was terrified at the prospect and abandoned the idea.</p>
			<p>Later, my family friends started sending their daughters to college. These daughters were told to apply to private schools, because there would be a better chance of them landing a rich guy--because apparently only rich people go to private schools.</p>
			<p>It upsets me that my culture discourages women--or rather, women who look a certain way--from educating themselves and pursuing other dreams. It's unfair that because of outdated beliefs, there's red tape that sets certain fields to be off-limits to women. It's not even because people believe that women have nothing valuable to offer; it's simply because "that's not what women do." And with a culture as persistent and stubborn as Taiwan's, that mentality is definitely not going away anytime soon.</p>
			<p>I don't see a "fix" for this problem in the near future--what I see happening to resolve this issue is for future parents/mentors/general life advisors to not perpetuate the idea that someone can't or shouldn't do something because of their identity. I leave you with this quote from Paul Bowles:</p>
			<blockquote>I've always wanted to get as far as possible from the place where I was born. Far both geographically and spiritually. To leave it behind... I feel that life is very short and the world is there to see and one should know as much about it as possible. One belongs to the whole world, not just one part of it.</blockquote>
