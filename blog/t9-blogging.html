      <p class="title">The experience of blogging</p>
      <p class="date"><--Date--></p>
      <p>Throughout Phase 0, I have been posting one technical and one cultural blog post each week. The technical blog post corresponded with the focus of that week (for example, HTML, Ruby or JavaScript) and the cultural topic was something related to personal growth (although I've noticed that prompts became more intense each week).</p>
      <p>For me, the success and quality of my technical posts depend on my grasp of the material. The better I understand it, the better I can explain and teach it to others. I really have enjoyed writing cultural blog posts more, because they give me a safe space to talk about difficult things that I don't have the courage to say out loud.</p>
      <p>Maintaining the appearance of my blog, though, hasn't been too much of a hassle. In the early weeks of Phase 0, I had a template that I was kind-of-sort-of okay with. <a href="http://jeremymcintyre.github.io/blog/index.html">Jeremy</a> was kind enough to say that it looked really friendly (thanks, Jeremy!) but something about the color scheme just felt kind of drab and muddy. My name as a header for every page also felt big and obnoxious.</p>
      <p>So I thought, what the heck, I'm going to redo my site. I went for a more simple color palette--everything goes with black, white, and gray, right? I think the current layout--Tiffany blue background and black sans serif text on white divs--looks so much cleaner and more vibrant. It still might be a bit cutesy for a professional blog, but for now, I like it.</p>
      <p>I plan to keep blogging through the rest of DBC--I'm not quite sure how often I'll do technical posts, but I definitely want to blog about the general experience. And maybe at the end I'll do a recap of the program. When I was doing research on coding bootcamps, I found personal stories lacking, so I want to be able to help future applicants in their decision making process!</p>
