      <p class="title">Pairing and Giving Feedback</p>
      <p class="date">November 4th, 2014</p><hr>
      <p>Something that I appreciate about DBC is its emphasis on collaboration and learning from each other. So far, I've pair-programmed over ten times, and each experience has been very different, depending on the challenge and my partner. In the past, I've almost always worked in an environment in which collaboration wasn't necessary, so I've never had to explain my thought process to anyone else. Pair programming has definitely challenged me to be more vocal and to think out loud. Since we are still relatively early in the the curriculum, I find that there is almost always a disparity between skill when I've paired. However, if I was more technically proficient than my partner was, I never felt like I was being "dragged down"; instead, I took that opportunity to practice guiding my partner through the challenge. On the other hand, if my partner had a more solid grasp on the challenge/concepts, I would try to gain as much technical knowledge from them as possible. So far, my only negative experience from pairing has been being afraid that I was dragging the pairing session; I would hate to make my partner feel like I've wasted their time. Thankfully, all my partners have been very kind and willing to teach me!</p>
      <p>I know that feedback is not always supposed to be "nice," but every time I read the feedback I've gotten, I feel loved (maybe that's because I haven't gotten <em>all</em> my feedback). It's kind of comforting to know that my partners like pairing with me, too! However, what I really need, I think, is an instructor's feedback. As we approach more and more advanced topics, I've definitely felt more of a struggle to get through certain challenges without pairing or getting help, so what would be really helpful would be for one of the DBC instructors to let me know how I'm doing and whether I'm keeping up with the curriculum. I understand that we should more or less "feel" if we are struggling too much, but it would be nice to know if this is the appropriate level of struggle.</p>
      <p>I haven't gotten very much constructive feedback--most of my partners have commented that I've been helpful and easy to work with--so it's nice to know that I've contributed positively in challenges. I can definitely feel that I can be more helpful technically, though, so my goal in the future is to tackle more challenges and get more reading done before pairing sessions, so that I'm as prepared as possible when I go into one.</p>
      <p>One challenge I've had in writing feedback has been finding tactful, unhurtful ways to give critical/constructive feedback. I've always struggled to have difficult conversations (and I hate confrontation). If my partner had been struggling with the material, I wasn't so sure about how to tell them to practice coding without sounding arrogant (and also, who am I to tell them that they need to improve technically?), and if my partner wasn't being collaborative or helpful, I didn't know how to tell them to be nice. But I think that's the point of DBC's focus on feedback--mean and true don't necessarily have to be the same thing; it just depends on the way you say it.</p>
