			<p class="title">Ruby: Arrays and Hashes</p>
			<p class="date">October 24th, 2014</p>
			<p>Today seems to be a significant date... 1024 = 2 ** 10. At any rate, today I'm going to talk about use of arrays and hashes in Ruby!</p>
			<p><strong>Arrays</strong> and <strong>hashes</strong> are both collections of data, in which indices are accessible with a key. Arrays are indexed by integers (starting with 0), while indices of hashes can be of any data type.</p>
			<p>A hash stores key-value pairs and can be used for programs like phonebooks; you would look up a name (a string) to retrieve its associated phone number (another string). In this case, it would make sense to use a string to represent the data's index, rather than an integer. Looking for, say, the third phone number in the collection is not necessarily of interest to the user, hence integers would not be its ideal identification.</p>
			<p>An array, on the other hand, is useful for creating data structures in which order is of importance, such as a list. Using an integer to represent a certain value would make more sense in ordering than, for example, a string. You may not have a data type that can better represent order than an integer (ie. the <strong>third</strong> item to do today vs. the <strong>yellow</strong> item to do).</p>
