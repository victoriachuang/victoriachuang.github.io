      <p class="title">Sorting algorithms</p>
      <p class="date">November 30th, 2014</p>
      <p>A <strong>sorting algorithm</strong> puts elements in a list in a certain order. The orders that are most commonly used are numerical and lexicographical (alphabetical) order. The output of a sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The output must not be in decreasing order (that is, each element must not be smaller than the preceding element)</li>
        <li>The output must be in a different order than the input</li>
      </ul>
      The strength of a sorting algorithm is based on its efficiency. Here are some popular sorting algorithms and their functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bubble sort</strong></li>
        <p>A bubble sorting algorithm works by iterating through a list and comparing two elements at the time; if the elements are in the incorrect order, they will be swapped, and this will continue until no elements need to be compared. Here is an illustration of a bubble sort:</p>

        <p>Bubble sort should not be used in the case of large data collections, and it is inefficient when the list is in reversed order.</p>
        <li><strong>Merge sort</strong></li>
        <p>Merge sort algorithms are comparison-based sorting algorithms. Here is a great illustration that show how it works:</p>

        <p>In this case, you take a list of numbers and break them into groups of two. In the first round of sorting, you compare each group of numbers and order them in ascending order. In the subsequent rounds of sorting, you take two groups and compare elements in their corresponding order.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>I hope this was helpful, and I hope you've had a great Thanksgiving weekend!</p>
