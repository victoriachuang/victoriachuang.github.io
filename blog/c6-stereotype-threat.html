      <p class="title">Stereotype Threat</p>
      <p class="date">November 9th, 2014</p><hr>
      <p>According to Claude M. Steele, stereotype threat is the theory of different racial or social groups feeling at risk of confirming negative stereotypes. This fear comes with the notion that, when differences between racial and social groups are being tested, something can go wrong with the group that is considered stereotypically inferior.</p>
      <p>The stereotype that I belong to is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS0KyTZ3Ie4">Cher Horowitz</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edytBejzBYM">Elle Woods</a> type. I love the color pink and dresses and makeup. And in true valley girl form, I decided early on that I wanted to pursue a career in fashion, and I dressed up as Snooki for Halloween in freshman year (all that has changed, but that's a story for another time). So even I was surprised when I a) decided to learn how to code, and b) actually ended up really loving it. In the past two years, I have largely grown out of that stereotype (and into the NYU-educated, liberated woman stereotype), but because I belonged to that group for so long, that's still the way my friends and family see me. A few months ago, I had been applying to other coding bootcamps, and when I told a friend about how I nailed the coding challenge, he said, "That's great! Who did it for you?" Although I don't consider myself belonging to that social group anymore, my experience of stereotype threat now is the fear of reverting back to being a valley girl, and still being seen as a spoiled princess.</p>
      <p>I feel that I have the basic foundations of being a good computer scientist--I am smart, a logical thinker, and a thoughtful communicator--but when I started Dev Bootcamp, I knew that I would have to work extra hard to be taken seriously. I have been told that I "definitely fill a quota" and that I am proof that anyone can code. So far, that label has been advantageous for me, because it has earned me opportunities (like interviews and a closer look at my applications), but I hope that once I start working, speaking, and proving myself, my work and my mind will be what represent me, not my stereotype. I am still experiencing stereotype threat, so I don't have a solution for it yet, but I think a key overcoming it is to build confidence in your abilities. I approach every obstacle with the "if they think you can't, prove that you can" attitude.</p>
      <p>Now, to negate this entire post, Legally Blonde is still the best movie ever, and here is an example of logical thinking:</p>
