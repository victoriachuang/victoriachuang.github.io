			<p>According to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Gregorc's Mind Styles model</a>, I am a <strong>concrete sequential</strong> thinker. A concrete perceptual quality means that I register information through my senses for what they are; I don't look for hidden meanings. A sequential ordering ability means that my mind organizes information in a linear fashion, ie. a series of steps.</p>
			<p>So far, my biggest challenge at DBC has been pairing in a manner that benefits both partners. I find that, since it's so early in the program and there are students that come from a variety of experiences/skills, there seems to almost always be a disparity in technical knowledge when I've paired. I have never experienced a pair session in which I have not benefitted in some way; when I have less programming experience than my partner, I have taken advantage of the opportunity to ask as many questions about good practices and better coding strategies. And when I am more technically proficient than my partner, I practice explaining the logic of a solution without outright giving them the code. So I have found that, in every pairing session, I've been able to work on my technical and/or communication skills, which works for me either way. However, I can't always tell if my partners have equally benefitted from pairing with me; I don't like the idea of wasting other people's time and dragging a pairing session, and that has been the most difficult part of unit 1 for me.</p>
			<p>I haven't had much difficulty learning new material in this unit, because for the most part I've learned the material before. However, I have noticed a change in the way I approach a problem set. In the past, I tried to jump straight into coding and expected to produce perfect code. However, as I've done more problem sets, I've found that a better approach is to slow down and list out in pseudocode what my code is supposed to do, organize it, and then turn it into code. This has consistently produced cleaner and less buggy code. I don't know if this necessarily a change in the way I think, but I see it as a change in perspective on how to work. In the past, I've worked and learned in situations where memorized answers are king, and analysis and problem solving are not necessarily goals--so you better get the answer right on the first go. Programming, though, is a whole other beast. Problems can be long and complicated, and the goal is to break it into simple steps. As I've tackled problem sets that start to look familiar, I catch myself spewing out memorized code; now that I can print 1 to 10 with ease, I think the next step in furthering my learning is to approach more complicated problems and to learn how to write more efficient code.</p>
