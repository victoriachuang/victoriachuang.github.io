			<p class="title">Week 2: CSS</p>
			<p class="date">October 17th, 2014</p>
			<p>This week's content was focused on HTML and CSS. Here are some design-related topics that I did some research on:</p>
			<p><strong>Margin vs. border vs. padding</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>I found this great image on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">W3Schools</a> that explains the differences between margins, borders, and padding. Imagine your content to be contained in a box. The <strong>padding</strong> creates some space between the content and the border. Stylistically, increasing padding will make your content look less cramped. The <strong>border</strong> is the box itself; it can be styled different ways, with options for width, color, and style (ie. dotted, dashed, etc.). The <strong>margin</strong> is the space between the box and other objects. Increasing margins, just like padding, can make your document look more balanced, especially if you have multiple objects on the page.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Best practices for using tables vs. divs</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tables and divs are both used to display information in an organized manner on a document, but it can be hard to decide which one to use. On Stack Overflow, I found a great answer as to when to use each one: if you would write it in Microsoft Word, use a div; if you would display it in Excel, use a table. A table is also best used to contain <strong>tabular data</strong>, such as data that would be best represented in a spreadsheet or grid.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Here are some resources that I found helpful for this topic:</p>
