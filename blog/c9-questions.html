      <p class="title">Asking perfect questions</p>
      <p class="date">December 5th, 2014</p>
      <p>The subject of asking questions the right way is a tricky subject. In my experience, it depends on the topic of the question, as well as the complexity of finding an answer. The more ambiguous the "correctness" of the answer, the more discussion goes into finding it.</p>
      <p>I was a nutrition major in college and I worked as a nutritionist shortly after graduating. I find that, unlike computer science, there are right and wrong answers in nutrition. For example, there are clear answers as to what creatine is and what the symptoms of GERD are. So I've found that it's much easier to have someone ask, "What is <code>#{some_topic}</code>?", and have me give a complete explanation of the concept, rather than having my partner tell me their understanding of the subject first--because if you misunderstand one part of a nutritional topic, you most likely misunderstood all of it. It's much less confusing for someone to hear one complete correct answer, rather than discussing the accuracy of each point of their explanation.</p>
      <p>However, it seems like asking coding questions is a whole different animal. In the past, I've asked a programmer friend, "What is a pull request?" and I thought he was a bit hesitant about answering my question--I suspect that it had seemed like I didn't do any research or put any thought into finding out the answer for myself. However, when I told him two different answers that I've gotten and where I was confused, he was much more proactive about explaining it to me.</p>
      <p>In the last few months, I've really only been asking coding-related questions, so that's what I'll talk about now. I've had some unanswered questions on Google+, and now I know why--they were so ambiguous. Because of the nature of coding, just asking why your function is throwing an error message is not enough, because so many things can go wrong! Context is of the utmost importance when you're trying to figure out where you went wrong with your code. Now, when I ask for coding help, ideally I would show my partner my code first (so that they'll know what it's supposed to do and we'll be on the same page), and then I'll tell them where I'm stuck, and ask how to fix it. This has been a much more effective way solve a problem and get answers, because your partner will then fully understand the question.</p>
      <p>This will be one of my last assigned blog posts before starting Phase 1 on Monday! I feel like a bit of the goon for counting down the days on my phone, but that's how excited I am :D I will still be blogging throughout the rest of the curriculum--I'm not quite sure about the frequency of technical posts, but I definitely will be updating decently frequently on the experience of DBC. When I was applying to coding bootcamps, I had trouble finding students' personal stories of the process, so I want to be able to help future applicants see if Dev Bootcamp will be a good fit!</p>
