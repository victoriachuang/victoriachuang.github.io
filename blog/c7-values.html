      <p class="title">Values and Identity</p>
      <p class="date">November 20th, 2014</p>
      <p>When I was in ninth grade, a guy named Raymond Chu transferred to my school. I think he was two years older than me, and I've never talked to him in my life, but he has had a profound influence on the way I perceive people (no, I didn't have a crush on him, but it's a good story nonetheless!). He was a typical theater geek--the difference was that he was very interested in old Hollywood, and wore amazing, tailored suits to school every day. And in the early 2000's in Taiwan, this was a huge scandal--everyone was wearing those terrible bootcut jeans and fake Abercrombie, and so Raymond Chu was made fun of a lot. Even my friends called him a poser who wanted attention, but I could tell he was being really genuine--that was who he was, and he was committed to that identity.</p>
      <p>Which leads to a story about how I came to realize who I am!</p>
      <p>As a good Chinese kid, I've always been inordinately obedient--thinking about what I really wanted wasn't even a thing. I've always done what my parents wanted--and I appreciate their guidance--but I never even thought about what I wanted out of life or a career.</p>
      <p>I feel incredibly cheesy saying this, but the proudest moment of my life so far has been enrolling in DBC, because it was the first time I've done something for myself. I'm really proud that I decided to learn how to code in the first place; it was so random and out of character for me, and a year ago, I wouldn't recognize myself right now. But it really showed me that I can do more than just spew out ten-page grant proposals or count calories (I was a community nutritionist in a past life); for the first time, I was actually thinking and solving problems. I really didn't consider applying to coding bootcamps until six months ago, when I was very unhappy at my job and skipping lunch breaks to learn Python and C. I needed income and "relevant experience," but I knew I was going to be miserable working as a counselor and hustling for funding for the rest of my life. I was very hesitant to call coding more than a hobby--until one day, we lost half our funding and my supervisor announced that I was being let go in front of the entire building's staff. (During our building's annual update meeting, the medical director was acknowledging retiring staff, and my supervisor stands up and says, "Also, Victoria won't be with us after June." Isn't that absolutely terrible?). Anyway, in that moment, I decided that I wanted to pursue programming. I started seeking advice from informed people--friends who work at Facebook, Google, and Brightroll (now part of Yahoo--sorry, Kevin), and decided that, yes, programming is what I want to do, and I can do it.</p>
      <p>I feel like such a rebel for doing DBC. I enrolled largely without seeking my parents' opinion, and, for the most part, this is not a popular decision among my family and friends. It's not because they don't believe in DBC (although an aunt told me I should pursue my doctorate in nutrition instead), but because it's just so strange for me, the Elle Woods of every interaction, to be into coding.</p>
      <p>The value that comes to mind when I think about the past year is commitment--that is, commitment to myself and the person I'm supposed to be. I'm way to young to actually know who I'm "supposed to be," but at least I now have found my passion and am thinking for myself. Once I came to the realization that I am a reasonable, smart adult who is capable of making sound decisions, I started to trust my seeing and judgment so much more.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, my Chinese name sounds a lot like "danger"--Danger Chuang. I don't actually live dangerously (my idea of danger is skipping Wednesday night class before Thanksgiving), but I try to remind myself to push myself more and to take risks--and to not be afraid of falling.</p>
