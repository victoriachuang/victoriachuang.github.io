      <p class="title">Variable Scope in Ruby</p>
      <p class="date">November 16th, 2014</p>
      <p>Ruby allows for many types of variables, each with their own scope to allow flexible modeling of classes and objects. Here are a few that may be useful!</p>
      <p><code>Global variables</code></p>
      <p>Global variables are denoted with a $ sign, and can be accessed across classes and files.</p>
      <p><code>Class variables</code></p>
      <p>Class variables are denoted with two @ signs ("@@") and can be accessed from any instance of a class. However, if a class variable is accessed and reassigned from an instance, the value of the variable will change for every instance of the class. Class variables may be assigned outside a class definition, but it will run a warning.</p>
      <p><code>Instance variables</code></p>
      <p>Instance variables are denoted with a single @ sign. Much like class variables, they are accessible within a class and from any instance of the class; however, a reassignment of an instance variable will be unique to that particular instance.</p>
      <p><code>Local variables</code></p>
      <p>Local variables are accessible only within a method. They are also inaccessible across files.</p>
