Cultural blog: Chefs in the Kitchen
My response to Shereef's fireside chat

After watching this video, my impression of the DBC experience hasn't changed, but it has confirmed what I thought it would be. DBC will not feed me the skills to become a developer; instead, it will give me to tools I need, and it's up to me to make the most of it. From what I know about DBC, it is truly a learn-by-doing environment, which I think is a perfect fit for me. I am very inexperienced, but I am a fast learner and hard worker, and if I'm passionate about something and have a goal, I will pour my heart into it. I'm very excited to jump in and to be immersed in this environment, but the intensity of the program is what is making me a little nervous.

Something that I've been wondering is, what do my cohortmates' families and friends think about all this? I'm from a very Taiwanese family, and everyone is urging me to instead pursue higher education and a more advanced degree. I personally believe that in tech, it's more about your skill set, knowledge, and experience, rather than the degree, but lacking that moral support is a bit discouraging.
