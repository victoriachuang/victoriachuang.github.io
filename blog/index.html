			<p>According to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Gregorc's Mind Styles model</a>, I am a <strong>concrete sequential</strong> thinker. A concrete perceptual quality means that I register information through my senses for what they are; I don't look for hidden meanings. A sequential ordering ability means that my mind organizes information in a linear fashion, ie. a series of steps.</p>
			<p>So far, my biggest challenge at DBC has been pairing in a manner that benefits both partners.</p>

			<p>Today seems to be a significant date... 1024 = 2 ** 10. At any rate, today I'm going to talk about use of arrays and hashes in Ruby!</p>
			<p><strong>Arrays</strong> and <strong>hashes</strong> are both collections of data, in which indices are accessible with a key. Arrays are indexed by integers (starting with 0), while indices of hashes can be of any data type.</p>

			<p>This week's content was focused on HTML and CSS. Here are some design-related topics that I did some research on:</p>
			<p><strong>Margin vs. border vs. padding</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>I found this great image on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">W3Schools</a> that explains the differences between margins, borders, and padding...</li>

			<p>After watching this video, my impression of the DBC experience hasn't changed, but it has confirmed what I thought it would be. DBC will not feed me the skills to become a developer; instead, it will give me to tools I need, and it's up to me to make the most of it. From what I know about DBC, it is truly a learn-by-doing environment, which I think is a perfect fit for me.</p>

			<p>Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp is almost over! I felt that this week's challenges have been pretty straightforward so far--a lot of readings and videos-and I learned the concepts best by doing. Coming into phase 0, I already had some knowledge of the command line (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.VDhRqdTF_FM">Harvard's CS50 course</a> was really helpful), so I spent the bulk of this week learning about Git and GitHub. I tried not to talk about Git in terms of "basically..." this week, because I know it's a lot more complicated and there's still a lot for me to learn about it, but here's some of what I took away from this week:</p>
