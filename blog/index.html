			<p class="date">November 30th, 2014</p>
      <p>A <strong>sorting algorithm</strong> puts elements in a list in a certain order. The orders that are most commonly used are numerical and lexicographical (alphabetical) order. The output of a sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The output must not be in decreasing order (that is, each element must not be smaller than the preceding element)</li>
        <li>The output must be in a different order than the input</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p><strong>What is SQL and what is it used for?</strong></p>
<p>SQL pronounced "sequel" stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard interactive and programming language for getting information from and updating a database. SQL lets you access and manipulate databases.</p>

			<p class="title" id="conflict">Conflict and the Compass of Shame</p>
			<p class="date">November 29th, 2014</p>
      <p>According to the Compass of Shame, we all lean toward one coping mechanism when we face conflict or shame:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal</strong>: You must physically or emotionally extract yourself from the situation</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidance</strong>: You avoid the conflict by immersing yourself in something else</li>
        <li><strong>Attack others</strong>: You lash out physically or verbally and target others</li>
        <li><strong>Attack self</strong>: You put yourself down</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The most emotionally difficult time of my life so far has been my relationship with my ex-boyfriend (I know--really personal, but really educational). We were best friends, and then we started dating. At the time, I was still doing my undergrad in New York, and he lived in the Bay Area, and we did long distance for almost three years before I graduated and moved to Cupertino. Like every relationship, it started out perfect. But have you ever experienced a situation where you think you're in love, and then when you get out of it, you realize that's not what love is? That's what happened to me.</p>

			<p class="title" id="values">Values and Identity</p>
			<p class="date">November 20th, 2014</p>
      <p>When I was in ninth grade, a guy named Raymond Chu transferred to my school. I think he was two years older than me, and I've never talked to him in my life, but he has had a profound influence on the way I perceive people (no, I didn't have a crush on him, but it's a good story nonetheless!). He was a typical theater geek--the difference was that he was very interested in old Hollywood, and wore amazing, tailored suits to school every day. And in the early 2000's in Taiwan, this was a huge scandal--everyone was wearing those terrible bootcut jeans and fake Abercrombie, and so Raymond Chu was made fun of a lot. Even my friends called him a poser who wanted attention, but I could tell he was being really genuine--that was who he was, and he was committed to that identity.</p>
      <p>Which leads to a story about how I came to realize who I am!</p>

			<p class="date">November 20th, 2014</p>
      <p>This week at Dev Bootcamp was focused on learning JavaScript. Before starting DBC, I had already completed the JS course on Codecademy, so I felt like I had a decent grasp of the language and syntax. For the most part, I didn't think this week was too much of a challenge; I think getting past the Ruby hurdles made this week feel like a breeze!</p>

			<p class="date">November 16th, 2014</p>
      <p>Ruby allows for many types of variables, each with their own scope to allow flexible modeling of classes and objects. Here are a few that may be useful!</p>
      <p><code>Global variables</code></p>
      <p>Global variables are denoted with a $ sign, and can be accessed across classes and files.</p>

			<p class="title" id="stereotypethreat">Stereotype Threat</p>
			<p class="date">November 9th, 2014</p>
			<p>According to Claude M. Steele, stereotype threat is the theory of different racial or social groups feeling at risk of confirming negative stereotypes. This fear comes with the notion that, when differences between racial and social groups are being tested, something can go wrong with the group that is considered stereotypically inferior.</p>
      <p>The stereotype that I belong to is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS0KyTZ3Ie4" target="_blank"><strong>Cher Horowitz</strong></a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edytBejzBYM" target="_blank"><strong>Elle Woods</strong></a> type.</p>

			<p class="date">November 6th, 2014</p>
			<p>Every object in Ruby belongs to a certain class (for example, strings belong to the String class). Classes determine an object's functionality and how you can manipulate data, so they're a convenient way to create several objects that you want to have similar behaviors (ie. have the same methods).</p>

			<p class="date">November 4th, 2014</p>
			<p>Something that I appreciate about DBC is its emphasis on collaboration and learning from each other. So far, I've pair-programmed over ten times, and each experience has been very different, depending on the challenge and my partner. In the past, I've almost always worked in an environment in which collaboration wasn't necessary, so I've never had to explain my thought process to anyone else. Pair programming has definitely challenged me to be more vocal and to think out loud.</p>

			<p>This week's challenges have definitely been a lot more time-consuming; I don't think I'm having any logical difficulties, but the hardest part has been researching Ruby methods and picking the most appropriate one to use. Here are some of Ruby's enumerable methods and how to use them:</p>

			<p class="date">October 27th, 2014</p>
			<p>This past weekend I marathoned <em>Silicon Valley</em>, which is supposed to give people a look into the tech world. One scene that really caught my attention was <a href="www.youtube.com/gKftzAbfcGU">this clip</a>. In a nutshell, the CEO of Hooli (fake Google) observes that every group of programmers is composed of the same elements; a mix of white, Indian, and Asian guys, and "a guy with crazy facial hair." As an Asian woman aspiring to work in tech, I belong to a significant minority--<a href ="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/29/178810467/blazing-the-trail-for-female-programmers">only about 20% of programmers are women</a>.</p>

			<p>According to <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Gregorc's Mind Styles model</a>, I am a <strong>concrete sequential</strong> thinker. A concrete perceptual quality means that I register information through my senses for what they are; I don't look for hidden meanings. A sequential ordering ability means that my mind organizes information in a linear fashion, ie. a series of steps.</p>
			<p>So far, my biggest challenge at DBC has been pairing in a manner that benefits both partners.</p>

			<p>Today seems to be a significant date... 1024 = 2 ** 10. At any rate, today I'm going to talk about use of arrays and hashes in Ruby!</p>
			<p><strong>Arrays</strong> and <strong>hashes</strong> are both collections of data, in which indices are accessible with a key. Arrays are indexed by integers (starting with 0), while indices of hashes can be of any data type.</p>

			<p class="date">October 10th, 2014</p>
			<p>After watching this video, my impression of the DBC experience hasn't changed, but it has confirmed what I thought it would be. DBC will not feed me the skills to become a developer; instead, it will give me to tools I need, and it's up to me to make the most of it. From what I know about DBC, it is truly a learn-by-doing environment, which I think is a perfect fit for me.</p>

			<p class="date">October 10th, 2014</p>
			<p>Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp is almost over! I felt that this week's challenges have been pretty straightforward so far--a lot of readings and videos-and I learned the concepts best by doing. Coming into phase 0, I already had some knowledge of the command line (<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.VDhRqdTF_FM">Harvard's CS50 course</a> was really helpful), so I spent the bulk of this week learning about Git and GitHub. I tried not to talk about Git in terms of "basically..." this week, because I know it's a lot more complicated and there's still a lot for me to learn about it, but here's some of what I took away from this week:</p>
